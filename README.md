# Static Site Starter

Static Site Starter contains all the files that you need to get started with building a simple static website. Basic included files for the header, footer and navigation bar. This is *not* an MVC framework or data driven website. Some of your clients still require a small website with only a handful of pages as an extended business card or simple portfolio site. But even this kind of site can become difficult to manage if each page is a separate entity.

A lot of the code here is basic boiler plate with as little clutter as possible so that you can quickly prototype a simple static site for your client. Create new pages by copying and renaming the template file as follows:

`cp template.php new_file.php`

## What's included

  * Three basic pages - home, about and contact which seem to be common on most sites.
